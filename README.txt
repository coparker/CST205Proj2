Description: This project takes the input from a sound file and creates a window. The window has an updating grayscale background that has it's color based off of the sound frequency data.
Usage: This project needs a hardcoded filepath in the audio.py file in order to extract the frequency from a particular song. The user entered filepath should match this filepath to avoid seeing a visual representation of another file. The head file that should be ran is the openAndPlayMusic.py.
